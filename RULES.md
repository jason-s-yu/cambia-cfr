# CAMBIA (a.k.a. Cabo, Cambio) RULES

**Objective:** End the game with the lowest total score.
**Players:** 2–6
**Deck:** Standard 52-card deck + 2 Jokers.

## 1. Card Values

Minimize your score. **Red Kings** are the best; **Black Kings** are the worst.

| Rank           | Value               |
| :------------- | :------------------ |
| **Red King**   | **-1** (Best Card)  |
| **Joker**      | 0                   |
| **Ace**        | 1                   |
| **2 - 10**     | Face Value          |
| **Jack**       | 11                  |
| **Queen**      | 12                  |
| **Black King** | **13** (Worst Card) |

## 2. The Setup

1. Deal **4 cards** face-down to each player arranged in a square (2x2).
2. Place the remaining deck (Stockpile) in the center. Flip the top card to start the **Discard Pile**.
3. **Memorize:** At the start *only*, players may peek at their **bottom two cards**. After this, you must rely on memory.

## 3. The Turn

Starting with the player to the dealer's left, take **one** of three actions:

### A. Draw from Stockpile

You look at the card and decide to:

1. **Swap:** Exchange it with one of your face-down cards (discard the old card face-up).
2. **Discard immediately:** If you discard it immediately, you may use its **Special Ability** (see Section 4).

### B. Draw from Discard Pile

Take the top visible card and **Swap** it with one of your face-down cards. (You *cannot* use Special Abilities when drawing from the discard pile).

### C. Call "Cambia"

If you believe you have the lowest score, call "Cambia" instead of drawing.

* Your turn ends immediately.
* Every other player gets **one final turn**.
* All cards are revealed.

## 4. Special Abilities

Abilities only trigger when you draw from the **Stockpile** and **discard immediately**.

* **7 or 8 (Peek Own):** Look at one of your own hidden cards.
* **9 or 10 (Peek Other):** Look at one of an opponent's hidden cards.
* **Jack or Queen (Blind Swap):** Swap one of your cards with an opponent's card (without looking at either).
* **King (Look & Swap):** Look at one of your cards and one of an opponent's; you may choose to swap them.

## 5. Snapping (The Speed Rule)

*Any time* a card is discarded (by any player), if you know exactly where a matching card is (in your hand OR an opponent's hand), you may race to "Snap" it onto the discard pile.

* **Snap Own:** If you snap your own card, you now have one fewer card (this is good!).
* **Snap Opponent:** If you snap an opponent's card, you must move one of your cards to fill their empty spot.
* **Penalty:** If you snap incorrectly (the cards don't match), you receive a **2-card penalty** from the deck.

## 6. Winning & Scoring

After a "Cambia" call and the final round:

1. Everyone sums their cards.
2. **Lowest Score Wins.**
3. If there is a tie among multiple players, the winner is the player who called "cambia," assuming they are among the tied winners.
